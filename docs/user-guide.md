## The stack safety problem

That a program is stack safe means that it won't overflow the stack, even for infinitely large input. Stack safety is
closely related to recursive algorithms, since deep recursion normally requires a large stack.  
 
Consider the following (binary) `Tree` type:
```java
public class Tree<A> {
    public abstract <B> B visit(
            Function<A, B> onLeaf,
            Function<Tree<A>, B> onUnaryBranch,
            BiFunction<Tree<A>, Tree<A>, B> onBinaryBranch);
}
```
_Example 1: A very basic Tree type_

Branches of this tree type can have either one or two children. None of the branches have any associated value. Each
leaf, however, has a value of type `A`. You might notice that there is no way that this type can represent an empty
tree. That doesn't matter much, this example is for instructional purposes only.
 
As it happens, this simple interface is all we need to inspect and traverse the tree. The `visit` method realizes a kind
of functional [visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern), but without the need for a separate 
`TreeVisitor` type. Instead, we must provide three callbacks, one for each node type.

We can make a very general purpose method for recursively traversing the leaves of a `Tree`:
```java
public class TreeOps {
    public static <A, B> B foldLeft(Tree<A> tree, BiFunction<B, A, B> reduce, B init) {
        return tree.visit(
                leafValue -> reduce.apply(init, leafValue),
                child -> foldLeft(child, reduce, init),
                (leftChild, rightChild) -> {
                    B leftAcc = foldLeft(leftChild, reduce, init);
                    B resultAcc = foldLeft(rightChild, reduce, leftAcc);
                    return resultAcc;
                });
    }
}
```
_Example 2: A stack unsafe recursive traversal algorithm_

`foldLeft` does a prefix traversal (from left to right), applying `reduce` to each leaf value to accumulate a result.
The accumulator is initialized with the value of `init`. Please spend a little moment to understand this algorithm
before proceeding.

This algorithm won't work if the depth of the tree is in the order of thousands. That case is not as contrived as you
might think; this tree type could be very fit for algorithms that need a type that offers a fast append operation, in
which case such trees could become very unbalanced, leaning either to the left or the right.

Now, a tail recursive algorithm can always be rewritten as a loop (see 
[Wikiedia: Tail call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)), but tree traversal is not, and can't be rewritten to
be, tail recursive. To make it stack safe, we must either rewrite the algorithm to use an explicit stack that resides
on the heap, or &mdash;
 
## Use a trampoline

A trampoline is a data structure that represents either an unevaluated calculation or a single value. Alternatively, it
can be viewed as a value that will be resolved later. Instead of running methods/functions immediately, we put them into
a type that can be run.

When a trampoline is run, it resolves the calculations inside one by one in a loop. When there are no more
unevaluated calculations left, the final calculated value is returned. This process is described in 
[Anatomy of `Trampoline`](https://mrbackend.github.io/java-trampoline/anatomy-of-trampoline.html).

To make `foldLeft` stack safe using a trampoline, we rewrite it like this:
```java
public final class TreeOps {
    public static <A, B> B foldLeft(Tree<A> tree, BiFunction<B, A, B> reduce, B init) {
        return trampolinedFoldLeft(tree, reduce, init).run();
    }

    private static <A, B> Trampoline<B> trampolinedFoldLeft(
            Tree<A> tree, 
            BiFunction<B, A, B> reduce, B init) {
        return tree.visit(
                leafValue -> Trampoline.ret(reduce.apply(init, leafValue)),
                child -> Trampoline.suspend(() -> trampolinedFoldLeft(child, reduce, init)),
                (leftChild, rightChild) -> {
                    Trampoline<B> leftAccTrampoline = Trampoline.suspend(() ->
                            trampolinedFoldLeft(leftChild, reduce, init));
                    Trampoline<B> resultAccTrampoline = leftAccTrampoline.flatMap(leftAcc ->
                            trampolinedFoldLeft(rightChild, reduce, leftAcc));
                    return resultAccTrampoline;
                });
    }
}
```
_Example 3: A stack safe recursive traversal algorithm_

`trampolinedFoldLeft` is a recursive method that immediately returns a `Trampoline` instance; only one `visit` at the
root is done at this point. There is a one-to-one correspondence between each part of `trampolinedFoldLeft` and 
Example 2's `foldLeft`. Before proceeding, have a look at the 
[Javadoc](https://mrbackend.github.io/java-trampoline/apidocs/) to learn about the `Trampoline` methods.

## The stack safe `foldLeft` explained

```java
leafValue -> Trampoline.ret(reduce.apply(init, leafValue))
```
_Example 3a: Trampolined left fold of a leaf_

This callback is used for leaves of the tree. When recursion hits the bottom, a value is returned. Since the
`foldLeft` method returns a `Trampoline`, the value must be wrapped in a `Trampoline`.

```java
child -> Trampoline.suspend(() -> trampolinedFoldLeft(child, reduce, init))
```
_Example 3b: Trampolined left fold of an unary branch_

This callback is used for unary (one-child) branches. If we left out the `suspend` here, `trampolinedFoldLeft` would
have been called immediately, leaving us with the exact problem we tried to solve. Hence, we wrap the recursive
call in a `suspend`, creating a trampoline that will do the recursive call later.

```java
(leftChild, rightChild) -> {
    Trampoline<B> leftAccTrampoline = Trampoline.suspend(() ->
            trampolinedFoldLeft(leftChild, reduce, init));
    Trampoline<B> resultAccTrampoline = leftAccTrampoline.flatMap(leftAcc ->
            trampolinedFoldLeft(rightChild, reduce, leftAcc));
    return resultAccTrampoline;
}
```
_Example 3c: Trampolined left fold of a binary branch_

This callback is used for binary (two-children) branches. When this branch is traversed, the left child is traversed
first, then the right child. Like the unary branch, we need to `suspend` the traversal of the left child, to avoid the
immediate recursion. In `foldLeft`, the accumulated result from traversing the left child is used in the traversal of
the right child. Hence, the second recursion is dependent of the first one, which is exactly what `flatMap` is for.

The last callback could also have been written as:
```java
(leftChild, rightChild) -> Trampoline.suspend(() -> {
    Trampoline<B> leftAccTrampoline = trampolinedFoldLeft(leftChild, reduce, init);
    Trampoline<B> resultAccTrampoline = leftAccTrampoline.flatMap(leftAcc ->
            trampolinedFoldLeft(rightChild, reduce, leftAcc));
    return resultAccTrampoline;
})
```
_Example 4: Alternative suspension of the traversal of a binary branch_
 
The difference is that instead of suspending the traversal of the left child, we suspend the traversal of the whole
branch. The two are equivalent with regards to functionality and stack safety. The only observable difference is that if
there were some time consuming computation while processing the branch node itself, the latter would create the
resulting trampoline faster, postponing the time consuming calculation until the resulting trampoline is run.

## Don't do this

A developer who's unfamiliar with trampolines might try to write the two-children branch traversal like this:
```java
(leftChild, rightChild) -> Trampoline.suspend(() -> {
    B leftAcc = trampolinedFoldLeft(leftChild, reduce, init).run();
    Trampoline<B> resultAccTrampoline = trampolinedFoldLeft(rightChild,reduce,leftAcc);
    return resultAccTrampoline;
})
```
_Example 5: Don't call `run` while creating a tramoline_
 
This is not stack safe. The reason is that when `run` is called, the corresponding code for child nodes is
"unsuspended", forcing the "unsuspension" of their child nodes and so on until the bottom of the recursion, possibly
causing a `StackOverflowError`. The golden rule is:

> Don't call `run` on a sub-trampoline of the trampoline you're creating!

A sign that you're doing it wrong is if you call `run` inside a method that returns a `Trampoline`. This is safe if
the trampoline you're running is unrelated (that is, not using any of the same recursive methods) to the one you're
creating, but even in that case it is better (with regards to maintainability) to use `map`/`flatMap`.

## Performance considerations

Even though the JVM's garbage collector is pretty amazing, doing things in a loop will always be faster than using a
trampoline. So, you should always consider rewriting the tail call part as a loop. `foldLeft` could be implemented like
this, where we traverse the left child of binary branches in a trampoline, and the tail recursion in a loop:
```java
public final class TreeOps {
    public static <A, B> B foldLeft(Tree<A> tree, BiFunction<B, A, B> reduce, B init) {
        return trampolinedFoldLeft(tree, reduce, init).run();
    }

    public static <A, B> Trampoline<B> trampolinedFoldLeft(
            Tree<A> tree, 
            BiFunction<B, A, B> reduce, 
            B init) {
        Trampoline<B> accTrampoline = Trampoline.ret(init);
        Tree<A> currTree = tree;
        while (isBranch(currTree)) {
            accTrampoline = trampolinedFoldLeftOfLeftChild(currTree, reduce, accTrampoline);
            currTree = getRightmostChild(currTree);
        }
        Tree<A> rightmostLeaf = currTree; 
        return accTrampoline.map(acc -> reduce.apply(acc, getLeafValue(rightmostLeaf)));
    }

    private static <A, B> Trampoline<B> trampolinedFoldLeftOfLeftChild(
            Tree<A> tree,
            BiFunction<B, A, B> reduce,
            Trampoline<B> initTrampoline) {
        return tree.visit(
                leafValue -> {
                    throw new AssertionError("Didn't you just test that this is a branch?");
                },
                child -> initTrampoline,
                (leftChild, rightChild) -> initTrampoline.flatMap(init -> 
                        trampolinedFoldLeft(leftChild, reduce, init)));
    }
}
```
_Example 6: Replacing tail recursion with a loop_

Note that we need to implement `isBranch`, `getRightmostChild` and `getLeafValue` as well. They're left out to help us
focus on the traversal logic. In this case, "loopifying" the tail call leads to more code and, for left-heavy and
balanced trees, the performance gain will be quite small. The lesson must be that it is not always best to rewrite tail
recursion as a loop. 

## Why is it called &mdash;

### "Trampoline"?

While running a trampoline, the stack returns to the same state between each step. If you look at a stack trace while
stepping through a trampolined calculation, you will observe this. It's like the stack pointer jumps up and down.

### "map"?

"Mapping" is a mathematical term which basically means associating a value in one domain with a value in another domain.
The `transformValue` function passed to `map` represents such a mapping.

### "flatMap"?

Imagine that there existed a function 
`static <A> Trampoline<A> flatten(Trampoline<Trampoline<A>> trampolinedTrampoline)`. Simply by studying the signature, 
you should be able to figure out what it does. Originally, the `map` and `flatten` terms were used for Lists, where
mapping from a list element to a list would produce a List of Lists. In that context, a function that converts a List of
Lists to a List is naturally named "flatten".

The expected relations between `ret`, `map`, `flatten` and `flatMap` are:
* `trampoline.map(transformValue) = trampoline.flatMap(value -> Trampoline.ret(transformValue.apply(value)))`
* `Trampoline.flatten(trampolinedTrampoline) = trampolinedTrampoline.flatMap(trampoline -> trampoline)`
* `trampoline.flatMap(calcNextTrampoline) = Trampoline.flatten(trampoline.map(calcNextTrampoline))`

The last relation should explain why `flatMap`: It is a composition of `flatten` and `map`.
